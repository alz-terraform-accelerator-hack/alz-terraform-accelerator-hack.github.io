# Challenge 03

**[Home](./introduction.md)**

## Description

In the final challenge we will try to utilize the "complete" starter_module where we can supply the accelerator a high-level configuration file which will can allow us to deploy any architecture we want. In this case we will be deploying a 3-region mesh network.

## Success Criteria

- Deploy a 3-region mesh network using the "complete" starter_module through a single pipeline run and without modifying the code post the accelerator deployment. HINT: Pass your configuration file using the `additional_files` PS variable.

## Resources
