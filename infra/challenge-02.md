**[Home](./introduction.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./challenge-03.md)

## Description

In this challenge, we will be leaning on the benefits of using Terraform by cleanly removing precisely what we deployed in the previous challenge. This includes the ALZ Environment in Azure, and all the artifacts deployed by the alz-terraform-accelerator.

## Success Criteria

- Cleanly remove the ALZ Environment in Azure, by utilizing the `destroy` flag on the continuous deployment pipeline.

- Cleanly remove all the artifacts deployed by the alz-terraform-accelerator, with terraform.
