# Best practices for deploying Infrastructure as Code with GitHub or Azure DevOps

## Introduction

This hack will utilise the [alz-terraform-accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator) to instantiate a secure DevOps process for deploying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with GitHub or Azure DevOps. The hack will also demonstrate how to deploy a secure CI/CD pipeline for deploying IaC with GitHub or Azure DevOps, lock down the pipeline to only allow approved changes to be deployed, and more.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the alz-terraform-accelerator.
- Discover how to deploy a secure CI/CD pipeline for deploying IaC with GitHub or Azure DevOps.
- Understand best practices in keeping your code base secure.
- Learn about existing GitHub and Azure DevOps features that will secure your pipelines.
- Learn about the various ways to authenticate to Azure through a remote agent.
