# Challenge 04

**[Home](./introduction.md)**

## Description

In this challenge you will deploy the alz-terraform-accelerator but you will be bringing your own `starter_module` (i.e. A directory of terraform code that you want to transform into a secure CI/CD Delivery.) You can use whichever VCS system you want.

## Success Criteria

- Successfully run the ALZ PowerShell Module, with a custom `starter_module`.

- Deploy the infrastructure in your main repo using Azure Pipelines/Workflows.

- Destroy all resources as you did in Challenge 02.
